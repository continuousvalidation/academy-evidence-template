# INTEKNIQUE Academy — Evidence Repository Template

This repository defines the **standard evidence structure** used by INTEKNIQUE Academy to document and evaluate applied professional competence.

The structure is intentionally domain-neutral and may be used across multiple subject areas where judgment, reasoning, and decision-making under constraints are required.

This repository serves as a **reference template**. Learners fork this repository and populate it with their own work.

This repository is a reference template. Contributions, issues, and pull requests are intentionally disabled.

## Purpose

The purpose of this repository is to provide a **consistent, auditable structure** for recording:

- Problem context
- Design reasoning
- Risk and tradeoff analysis
- Final decisions
- Reflective limitations

The emphasis is on **decision traceability**, not correctness or outcome optimization.

---

## Scope

This repository structure is used to support evaluation of applied competence in professional learning programs administered by INTEKNIQUE Academy.

It is not:
- An assignment specification
- A grading rubric
- A collection of example solutions
- A certification guarantee

Completion of this repository alone **does not imply certification**.

---

## Evidence Principles

Evidence produced using this structure is expected to demonstrate:

- Explicit problem framing
- Clear articulation of assumptions
- Consideration of constraints and risks
- Reasoned tradeoffs
- Defensible decision-making
- Awareness of limitations and uncertainty

There is no single correct solution.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized to reflect a logical progression from context to reflection.

### `/01-context`
Defines the problem space and relevant constraints.

- `problem-statement.md`  
  Description of the problem being addressed and its significance.

- `regulatory-context.md`  
  Applicable standards, expectations, or external constraints, where relevant.

---

### `/02-design`
Documents potential approaches and assumptions.

- `architecture.md`  
  Conceptual design or approach. Diagrams may be included if helpful.

- `assumptions.md`  
  Explicit assumptions made and rationale for their use.

---

### `/03-analysis`
Captures analytical reasoning.

- `risks.md`  
  Key risks, uncertainties, and failure modes considered.

- `tradeoffs.md`  
  Alternatives evaluated and the basis for selecting among them.

---

### `/04-decision`
Records the final position.

- `final-recommendation.md`  
  The decision reached and justification based on prior analysis.

---

### `/05-reflection`
Documents reflective awareness.

- `limitations.md`  
  Known limitations of the analysis and conditions under which conclusions may change.

---

## Use and Submission

Learners are expected to:

- Fork this repository into their own GitHub account
- Populate the files with original work
- Retain the required structure
- Submit the repository URL as evidence where requested

Learners retain ownership of their content.

---

## Governance Notes

- This repository is intentionally non-collaborative.
- Issues, discussions, and pull requests are disabled.
- The structure is maintained as a stable reference.

Evidence repositories may be reviewed in connection with credential issuance or verification but do not replace formal governance records.
